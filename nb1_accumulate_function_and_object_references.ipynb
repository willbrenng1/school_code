That means the computational algorithm takes $\\mathcal{O}(n+k)$ steps. In this case, doubling the input or output will double the computational cost, which seems like a reasonable price to pay."

Learning these idioms helps improve the readability of your code by making it more concise and using patterns that should be familiar to other Python programmers. The examples you saw here included **slicing for lists**, **higher-level functions** (like `sum` and `accumulate`), **list comprehensions** (use judiciously!), **helper functions**, and **zipper iteration**."

These are functions that take other functions as input and use them. List comprehensions are one example: the comprehension `[f(e) for e in x]` works for any function `f` that can take the input `e`. The use of `accumulate` customized to do additions (the default), multiplications, minimums, or whatever it is you need to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, are all additional examples."
